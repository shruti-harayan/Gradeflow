# GradeFlow 🎓  
**A Rule-Based Academic Grading & Workflow Management System**

GradeFlow is a web-based grading system designed for colleges to replace spreadsheet-based mark entry workflows. It enables teachers to enter question-wise marks, automatically compute totals using predefined rules, and submit finalized results in a controlled manner. Administrators can review, lock/unlock exams, and download clean Excel/CSV reports for examination processing.

---

## 📌 Problem Addressed

In many colleges, teachers use Excel sheets to enter marks and calculate totals manually. If errors are found after submission, files are repeatedly edited and renamed (e.g., *final*, *updated*, *final_v2*), creating confusion for examination committees.

GradeFlow solves this problem by:
- Eliminating manual calculations
- Enforcing rule-based evaluation
- Providing clear draft and final submission states
- Maintaining a single authoritative dataset

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Rule-Based Evaluation**  
  Supports grading rules like “answer any N out of K sub-questions”.

- **Workflow Control**  
  Explicit states: *Draft → Final → Locked* to prevent accidental edits.

- **Single Source of Truth**  
  No multiple Excel versions; one finalized dataset per exam.

---

## 🖥️ System Architecture

GradeFlow follows a **three-tier architecture**:

1. **Frontend (Presentation Layer)**  
   - React-based UI for teachers and admins  
   - Handles user interaction and visualization  

2. **Backend (Application Layer)**  
   - REST APIs built with FastAPI  
   - Business logic, validation, and workflow enforcement  

3. **Database (Data Layer)**  
   - Relational database for structured storage of marks, exams, and users
